## Problem

> Read the rules of the competition and get a little bonus!

The challenge comes with a link to the picoCTF competition rules page [1][2] and a hint that states "Ctrl-F will not work."

## Solution

This is honestly just a test in reading comprehension, focusing and patience. There is an image inlined near the test "... school identified by the Team leader, and/or the name of the School identified by the Team leader ..." with the picoCTF flag in it.

The flag is: ``picoCTF{h34rd_und3r5700d_4ck_cba1c711}``.

__TODO:__ write a script to find the flag via a OCR method.
