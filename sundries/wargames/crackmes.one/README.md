## On Quality Control for Solution Writeups

Some are inclined to ask, "how can we be sure that Aleksey's solutions are of decent quality and standards?" To answer this, I submit my solutions to the ``crackmes.one`` website and put a direct link. On the [crackmes.one FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20241117143438/https://crackmes.one/faq), the website administrators note that they have a quality control mechanism that only publishes good quality writeups, and rejects low quality writeups.

When faced with the complaint that: "I submitted a crackme/solution but it does not appear on the website," ``crackmes.one`` responds with:

> "Every crackme/solution is validated before appearing on the website. This may take anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days." - quoted verbatim from [crackmes.one FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20241117143438/https://crackmes.one/faq)

Furthermore, when faced with the more severe complaint: "My solution does not appear on the website after many days," ``crackmes.one`` replies with:

> "This is probably because your solution got rejected. Please, upload an explaination of how you managed to solve the crackme, not just a simple keygen.py file. More generally there's only one rule: don't patch! Unless the author explicitely said that patching is a valid solution, don't do it. Write your keygen, write your solution. You'll learn more by doing this." - quoted verbatim from [crackmes.one FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20241117143438/https://crackmes.one/faq)

This indicates that submitted writeups go through some semblance of a quality control mechanism. Unfortunately, the ``crackmes.one`` admins do not elaborate what makes for a quality writeup - beyond the rule that software patching is forbidden unless explicitly permitted by the author - so writeups published onto the ``crackmes.one`` website cannot be given the distinction of "peer review." But nonetheless, there is a semblance of a quality control mechanism put into place, meaning that writeups published onto their website are of higher worth than a self-published blog post, but still of less worth than a peer-reviewed publication.

## Endnotes

* ZIP archives coming from the ``crackmes`` website are password protected, so when downloading my writeups (or any other material) published onto their website, use the password ``crackmes.one`` or ``crackmes.de`` to unzip the files.
* Regarding some of the columns in the above table:
    * The __"Writeup (on crackmes.one)"__ column is a direct link to the ``crackmes.one`` website. I directly link to their site because, according to [their FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20241117143438/https://crackmes.one/faq), they have place in some quality control mechanism to make sure that submitted solutions make sense.
    * The __"Project Files"__ column contains a link to a folder in this repository of the respective solution's project files, which contain a local copy of the writeup, and some of the materials that I used to derive a solution.
