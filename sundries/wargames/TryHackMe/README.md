* __Red Team Fundamentals:__ Learn the core components of a red team engagement, from threat intelligence to OPSEC and C2s.
    * ~~[Red Team Fundamentals]()~~: Learn about the basics of a red engagement, the main components and stakeholders involved, and how red teaming differs from other cyber security engagements.
    * ~~[Red Team Engagements]()~~: Learn the steps and procedures of a red team engagement, including planning, frameworks, and documentation.
    * ~~[Red Team Threat Intel]()~~: Apply threat intelligence to red team engagements and adversary emulation.
    * ~~[Red Team OPSEC]()~~: Learn how to apply Operations Security (OPSEC) process for Red Teams.
    * ~~[Intro to C2]()~~: Learn the essentials of Command and Control to help you become a better Red Teamer and simplify your next Red Team assessment!
* __Initial Access:__ Explore the different techniques to gain initial access to a target system and network from a Red Teamerâ€™s perspective.
    * ~~[Red Team Recon]()~~: Learn how to use DNS, advanced searching, Recon-ng, and Maltego to collect information about your target.
    * ~~[Weaponization]()~~: Understand and explore common red teaming weaponization techniques. You will learn to build custom payloads using common methods seen in the industry to get initial access.
    * ~~[Password Attacks]()~~: This room introduces the fundamental techniques to perform a successful password attack against various services and scenarios.
    * ~~[Phishing]()~~: Learn what phishing is and why it's important to a red team engagement. You will set up phishing infrastructure, write a convincing phishing email and try to trick your target into opening your email in a real-world simulation.
* __Post Compromise:__ Learn about the steps taken by an attacker right after gaining an initial foothold on a network.
    * ~~[The Lay of the Land]()~~: Learn about and get hands-on with common technologies and security products used in corporate environments; both host and network-based security solutions are covered.
    * ~~[Enumeration]()~~: This room is an introduction to enumeration when approaching an unknown corporate environment.
