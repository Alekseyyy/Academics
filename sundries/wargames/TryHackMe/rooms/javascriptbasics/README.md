## Simple JavaScript sorting algorithm

Simple sorting algorithm implemented in JavaScript that sorts numbers from least to greatest for ["GhostlyPy" (2020)](https://tryhackme.com/room/javascriptbasics)'s JavaScript Basics room.

__CodePen__: you can check out a simple front-end that I programmed which uses the sorting algorthm on CodePen [here](https://codepen.io/EpsilonCalculus/full/ZEXMxYr) (and [here](https://codepen.io/EpsilonCalculus/pen/ZEXMxYr) if you want to see the HTML/CSS/JavaScript code side by side).
