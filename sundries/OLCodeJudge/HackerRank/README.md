| [Day 0: Hello, World](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-data-types/problem) | [C++](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day0.cpp) | Feb. 4, 2024 | In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you started with this series. | |
| [Day 1: Data Types](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-data-types/problem) | [C++](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day1.cpp) | Feb. 4, 2024 | Today, we're discussing data types. | |
| [Day 2: Operators](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-operators/problem) | [C++](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day2.cpp) | Feb. 19, 2024 | In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators. | |
| [Day 3: Intro to Conditional Statements](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-conditional-statements/problem) | [C++](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day3.cpp) | Feb. 19, 2024 | In this challenge, we learn about conditional statements. | |
| [Day 4: Class vs. Instance](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-class-vs-instance/problem) | [C++](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day4.cpp) | Feb. 21, 2024 | In this challenge, we're going to learn about the difference between a class and an instance; because this is an Object Oriented concept, it's only enabled in certain languages. | |
| [Day 5: Loops](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-loops/problem) | [C++](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day5.cpp) | Feb. 21, 2024 | In this challenge, we will use loops to do some math. | |
| [Day 6: Let's Review](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-review-loop/problem) | [C++](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day6.cpp) | Feb. 21, 2024 | Today we will expand our knowledge of strings, combining it with what we have already learned about loops. | |
| [Day 7: Arrays](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-arrays/problem) | [C++](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day7.cpp) | Feb. 21, 2024 | Today, we will learn about the Array data structure. | |
| [Day 8: Dictionaries and Maps](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-dictionaries-and-maps/problem) | [C++](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day8.cpp) | Feb. 22, 2024 | Today, we're learning about Key-Value pair mappings using a Map or Dictionary data structure. | |
| [Day 9: Recursion 3](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-recursion/problem) | [C++](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day9.cpp) | Feb. 24, 2024 | Today, we are learning about an algorithmic concept called recursion. | |
| [Day 10: Binary Numbers](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-numbers/problem) | [C++](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day10.cpp) | Feb. 24, 2024 | Today, we're working with binary numbers. | |
| [Day 11: 2D Arrays](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-2d-arrays/problem) | [C++](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day11.cpp) | Feb. 24, 2024 | Today, we are building on our knowledge of arrays by adding another dimension. | |
| [Day 12: Inheritance](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-inheritance/problem) | [C++](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day12.cpp) | Feb. 24, 2024 | Today, we're delving into Inheritance. | |
| [Day 13: Abstract Classes](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-abstract-classes/problem) | [C#](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day13.cs) | circa 2017 | Today, we will extend what we learned yesterday about Inheritance to Abstract Classes. Because this is a very specific object oriented concept, submissions are limited to the few languages that use this construct. | |
| [Day 14: Scope](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-scope/problem) | [C++](./tutorials/30-days-of-code/day14.cpp) | Feb. 28, 2024 | Today we're discussing scope. | |
