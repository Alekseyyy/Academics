## Introduction

This course discusses operating platforms - which are the various layers of abstraction that enable software developers to implement their ideas, expressed in terms of an algorithm, into something that can be executed automatically. This ranges from hardware components, to the operating system, all the way to developer APIs on the computer and on the internet.

To demonstrate notions in operating platforms, this class tasked myself with writing up technical documentation and a little bit of software commits for a fictious game called _Draw It or Lose It_. The game allows for individual players to join into teams where they compete against each other to guess the thing being depicted on an image as it is slowly being rendered onto a computer screen. It is a task given to us by the hypothetical company: _The Gaming Room_. 

## Coursework

To demonstrate my working knowledge of operating platforms, I was tasked with designing an online game called _Draw It or Lose It_, mainly by writing up documentation and writing some code. 

### Course Capstone

The following is the culmination of my work for this course

* [Draw It or Lose It: Software Design Document](./final.pdf): this is a technical writeup where I introduce, describe and discuss the _Draw It or Lose It_ game. I discuss how to go about designing the software with a UML diagram, selecting the optimal operating platforms for its server and client computer systems, and also discussing what tools developers can use to implement the game.

* Project Contributions: These are my contributions to the Java source code of the game:
    * [First commit](./software/module2): here, I added code to ``GameService.java`` which implemented ``get*()`` and ``set*()`` methods to access private data.
    * [Second commit](./software/gameauth.zip_expanded): here, I added code that would manage authentication and logins to _Draw It or Lose It_ using a RESTful API.
