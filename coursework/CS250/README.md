## Introduction

## Coursework

[tbd]

### Capstone Project

The following is the culmination of my work for this course:

* [Final Paper](./capstone/paper.pdf): this paper discusses applying the _Agile_ and _Scrum_ framework to a hypothetical software development firm called ChadaTech. I discuss the new model of software development, and different kinds of tools to make the software work. I also compare and contrast the older _Waterfall_ model to Agile.

* [Final Presentation](./capstone/pres.pdf): this is a PowerPoint presentation that introduces the Agile framework; which accompanies the final paper.

## Discussion

The following are my responses to the prompts given from _Assignment 8-2:_

### Interpreting User Needs

> "How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?"



### Approach to Software Development

> "How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?"


### Good Teamwork 

> "What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?"
