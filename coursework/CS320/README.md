## Projects

* The [Case Study](./case-study): is the project that I developed throughout the course. It is a Java library that implements an in-memory database where information is stored with a unique ``String`` ID and a corresponding abstract data type as its value. The intresting stuff comes in where I use the [JUnit 5 Unit Testing Framework](https://junit.org/junit5/) to demonstrate that the library did its computations correctly. 
* The [final paper](./7-2_Final.pdf) is where I document my experiences programming the in-memory database and writing ``public class`` that take the place of a C/C++ ``struct`` to store properties of a "kind" of thing.  ``Strings`` (and a ``java.util.Date`` object) define what makes for an abstract type, storing information that is in accordance with constraints supplied by design documentation in the form of project requirements.
