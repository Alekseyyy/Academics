> "Students will apply software engineering testing strategies and practices as part of the software development lifecycle, including requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality management. The creation of unit tests and analysis of various testing approaches will also be covered." - Course Description of [CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance](https://archive.today/rcw2t)

## Projects

* The [Case Study](./case-study): is the project that I developed throughout the course. It is a Java library that implements an in-memory database where information is stored with a unique ``String`` ID and a corresponding abstract data type as its value. The intresting stuff comes in where I use the [JUnit 5 Unit Testing Framework](https://junit.org/junit5/) to demonstrate that the library did its computations correctly. 
* The [final paper](./7-2_Final.pdf) is where I document my experiences programming the in-memory database and writing ``public class`` that take the place of a C/C++ ``struct`` to store properties of a "kind" of thing.  ``Strings`` (and a ``java.util.Date`` object) define what makes for an abstract type, storing information that is in accordance with constraints supplied by design documentation in the form of project requirements.
