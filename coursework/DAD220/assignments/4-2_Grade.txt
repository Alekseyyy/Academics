Lecturer's comments:
"""
The SELECT statement is used to select data from one or more tables:
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
or 
we can use the * character to select ALL columns from a table:
SELECT * FROM table_name

DELETE FROM `table_name` tells MySQL server to remove rows from the table ..
[WHERE condition] is optional and is used to put a filter that restricts the number of rows affected by the DELETE query.

In MySQL, the term cardinality refers to the uniqueness of data values that can be put into columns. It is a kind of property which influences the ability to search, cluster and sort data.
Low Cardinality − All values for a column must be same.
High Cardinality − All values for a column must be unique.
The concept of high cardinality is used if we put a constraint on a column in order to restrict duplicate values.
