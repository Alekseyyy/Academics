Lecturer's comments:
"""
schema is synonymous with database. As the query is written to create the database, similarly the query can be written to create the schema.
Logical structure can be used by the schema to store data while memory component can be used by the database to store data. 
Also, a schema is collection of tables while a database is a collection of schema.

create database yourDatabaseName;
The CREATE TABLE statement allows you to create a new table in a database.
The following illustrates the basic syntax of the CREATE TABLE  statement:
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name(
   column_1_definition,
   column_2_definition,
   ...,
   table_constraints
);
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
