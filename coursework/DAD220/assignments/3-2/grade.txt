Lecturer's comments:
"""
To rename a table in MySQL you just need to run a command named RENAME TABLE, the syntax is very easy to use,
RENAME TABLE tb1 TO tb2;

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
After creating your table, you need to populate it. The LOAD DATA and INSERT statements are useful for this.
MySQL SQL Syntax:
SELECT column_a,column_b,column_c+column_d INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/result.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
FROM test_table;
The objective of the lab was to learn how to create a query use JOINS to retrieve data; understand the use and application of join functions. 
You did a great work with the lab unit.Keep up the work! You are doing great.
