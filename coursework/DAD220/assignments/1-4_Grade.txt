Create a Database With Your Name
The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new SQL database.
On the production systems you should have admin privilege before creating any database. 
Once a database is created, 
you can check it in the list of databases with the SQL command: SHOW DATABASES;

Create a Table Called tb2 and List Table in Database
CREATE TABLE is the keyword that tells the database system to create a new table. There is a unique name or identifier for the table that follows.
Then in brackets comes the list defining each column in the table and what sort of data type it is. 
After the data type, you can specify other optional attributes for each column:
NOT NULL,DEFAULT,UNSIGNED,AUTO INCREMENT,PRIMARY KEY
Each table should have a primary key column. Its value must be unique for each record in the table.
The syntax that you used in the exercise makes it more clear. 

Add a Second Field
The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.

The objective of the lab was to learn how to develop a framework for a functional database; create tables, columns,
and keys within a new database created You did great work with the unit. You are doing great.
