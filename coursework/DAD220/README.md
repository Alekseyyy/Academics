## DAD-220: Introduction to Structured Database Environments

This is a course that I took that taught its students to do database engineering---with an emphasis on relational databases and the SQL programming language. The [course syllabus](./DAD 220 Syllabus.pdf) and [course infographic](./DAD 220 Course Infographic.pdf) discussess these in detail.

This course culminated into the creation of a MySQL-powered relational database \([discussed here](./assignments/6-1/submission.pdf)\) and the use of the SQL programming language to do rudimentary data analysis \([discussed here](./assignments/7-1/submission.pdf)\).
