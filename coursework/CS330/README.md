## CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization

> "Students will create realistic, interactive three-dimensional objects through the use of application programming interface (API) libraries and best practices. Students will also develop fully formed graphic applications that meet project requirements." - From the [SNHU Course Catalog](http://web.archive.org/web/20231115161441/https://www.snhu.edu/admission/academic-catalogs#/courses/view/63fe2de7e698f7ed682369ac)

CS-330 is arguably the most difficult course in _Southern New Hampshire University's_ computer science programme. The following are tutorials that have been created to help students taking this course do as well as they can:

* ["CS-330" YouTube playlist & video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI5uOhAD-G-MdbltQJdcrO_tzMfqXvZU0) by user ["SNHU Computer Science"](https://www.youtube.com/@snhucomputerscience).
* A discussion of absolute paths versus relative paths, useful for configuing the IDE to use libraries \([Programmer Sought, n.d.](https://programmersought.com/article/27101006403/)\)
* [OpenGL Examples (n.d.)](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/openglexamples/) from what appears to be a university student or teacher's lecture notes.

The following are open textbooks and other resources recommended by the course instructor for each week or module:

<details>
  <summary>Module 1: Introduction to OpenGL</summary>

  <summary>Module 2: Working with 2D Shapes</summary>
