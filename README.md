### Articulated to college credit

Some online courses that I took were able to be articulated to college credit at SNHU. Here is a full list of them:

|__Online course__|__Provider__|__SNHU course name__|__SNHU course number__|
|-----------------|------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/ba83ef4d67d94dca87154ed312181845) | edX | Introduction to Scripting | ~~todo~~ |
| [Introduction to Java Programming](./coursework/IT145) | Sophia Learning | Foundations of Application Development | IT145 |

### Open Source Society University (OSSU)

A significant educational project that I am working on is a (unaccredited, but cheap) set of STEM "majors" from the [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu) --- or simply just the "OSSU." This GitHub repository also includes all of my other non-accredited coursework that is not directly associated with the curriculum proposed by the OSSU project. It is basically a semi-formal way to validate my skills in computing and its relationship to other fields.

This project is so big that it deserves its own github repo and I recommend that you check it out if you're interested in some of my extracuricullar activities: [https://github.com/Alekseyyy/ossu](https://github.com/Alekseyyy/ossu)

## Sundries

Outside of school, I like to "stay sharp" by doing computer science practice with sundry textbook problems, and practice systems/other programming, practice information security and other kinds of computer-based practice. I also like to dabble in other STEM and humanities related fields.
