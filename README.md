### Open Source Society University (OSSU)

A significant educational project that I am working on is a (unaccredited, but cheap) computer science "major" from the [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu)--- or simply just the "OSSU." This is a project so big that it deserves its own github repo, and I recommend that you check it out if you're interested in my extracuricullar activities: [https://github.com/Alekseyyy/ossu](https://github.com/Alekseyyy/ossu)

My "OSSU" GitHub repository also includes all of my other non-accredited coursework that is not directly associated with the curriculum proposed by the OSSU project. It is basically a semi-formal way to validate my skills in computing and its relationship to other fields.

## Sundries

Outside of school, I like to "stay sharp" by doing computer science practice with sundry textbook problems, and practice systems/other programming, practice information security and other kinds of computer-based practice. I also like to dabble in other STEM and humanities related fields.

I also have a github repository called "[ctfs](https://github.com/Alekseyyy/ctfs)" where I document my achievements (and failures) in the world of infosec and competitive computer programming.
